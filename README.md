# Smart_Irrigation_System
Solar powered irrigation controller that detects moisture content in the soil, and if it falls below a certain limit during the day, solenoid valves are turned on to water the soil.
If moisure content falls below the specified limit at night, the solenoid valve is not opened.
Real-time moisture content is uploaded to thingspeak for visualization and analysis.
